## Project Goals
This project aims to investigate the relationship between insertion sequences and antibiotic resistance phenotypes by analyzing draft and complete genomes. The goal is to identify patterns in insertion sequence distribution among susceptible and resistant isolates and visualize the findings.
## Approach
The approach involves comparing coding sequences from each isolate against databases using [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). These databases may include [The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database](https://card.mcmaster.ca/), to identify genes associated with antibiotic resistance, as well as [IS Finder](https://isfinder.biotoul.fr/#), to identify insertion sequences. Once the insertion sequences and resistance genes are identified, the team will compare the insertion sequence profile between resistant and susceptible [isolates](https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/amr-2024-team-montes-de-oca/blob/main/Assemblies_Team_Montes_de_Oca.xlsx). A code to start finding these elements is [here](https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/amr-2024-team-montes-de-oca/blob/main/Notebook.ipynb).
The output tables obtained from the script have the following format:

#### Output from approach nÂ°1
A table file including the following columns:
* qseqid: query sequence id, usually the contig name from a given draft genoma
* sseqid: subject sequence id, the antibiotic resistance gene sequence name
* pident: identity percentage
* ppos: similarity percentage
* len: BLAST alignment length
* qstart: query sequence start position
* qend: query sequence end position
* sstart: subject sequence start position
* send: subject sequence end position
* evalue: BLAST alignment evalue
* scov: subject coverage percentage
